## Creativity/Features

- Azure VM link: [http://lim31.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/](http://lim31.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/)
- Running on Azure VM (auto shuts off at 4 AM everyday):
1. `ssh lim31@lim31.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`
2. `cd /var/www/html/iit/labs/lab6`
3. `export MONGODB_URI='mongodb+srv://misherelle:[MY_PASSWORD]@cluster0.vfzaibr.mongodb.net/'`
4. `npm start` (and install anything else as prompted to by the terminal, like concurrently, d3, tippy, etc.)

- Local link: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
- Running locally:
1. Run `npm start`

- Lab 7 starts when you select one of the GET button options in the "Weather Ticker" section of the page - the 4 data visualizations should be displayed right above the data and the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE input fields
- When you hover over over each bar or data point in the visualizations, the information for that data point displays using Tippy.js!

- Default data set (300 documents - 100 per API souce):
1. Run [http://localhost:3000/fetch-accuweather](http://localhost:3000/fetch-accuweather)
2. Run [http://localhost:3000/fetch-openweather](http://localhost:3000/fetch-openweather)
3. Run [http://localhost:3000/fetch-weatherapi](http://localhost:3000/fetch-weatherapi)

- Stock ticker app, with a pixel art plant and nature design theme, displaying stock data and currency conversion information from Market Data, Frankfurter, custom database APIs, as well as 3 weather APIs - with a calming and alluring aesthetic built with the help of Vite
- If mouse hovered over email link in the footer, it will directly allow you to email me
- If mouse hovered over "RPI" link in the footer, it will directly allow you to go to the rpi.edu main webpage
- Clicking the page title and logo will redirect you back to the page
- Green color theme to signify the color of USD bills, as well as using it psychologically as a "feel good" and positively reinforcing color for the users
- Hidden feature: hovering over images of stuffed animal ducks will make the flip horizontally quickly -- as if they're dancing!
